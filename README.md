📊 Data Analytics Project – From Cleaning to Power BI Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analytics workflow, starting from data cleaning & preprocessing in Python, moving through exploratory data analysis (EDA), and finally creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights.

The goal is to showcase my ability to handle raw data, transform it into meaningful insights, and present them in a business-friendly way.

🗂️ Steps Covered
1. 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values using fillna() / dropna()

Fixed data types (numeric, categorical)

Detected and treated outliers

2. 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate Analysis: Histograms, countplots

Bivariate Analysis: Scatter plots, boxplots

Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps

Identified important trends and relationships

3. 🔹 Data Visualization & Reporting (Power BI)

Created dashboards to present insights

Used Bar charts, Line charts, Pie/Donut charts, Scatter plots, Gauge charts

Added interactivity for business-friendly exploration

Provided actionable recommendations based on data insights

📊 Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for coding & analysis
